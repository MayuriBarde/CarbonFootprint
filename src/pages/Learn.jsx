        <h1>Learn About Sustainability</h1>
        <p>
          Understanding environmental sustainability is the first step toward
          reducing our impact on the planet. This section provides essential
          knowledge and practical guidance.

        <h2>What is Sustainability?</h2>
        <p>
          Sustainability refers to meeting our present needs without
          compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. It
          focuses on environmental protection, social responsibility, and
          economic balance.

        <h2>Understanding Carbon Footprint</h2>
        <p>
          A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions caused
          by an individual, organization, or activity. These emissions mainly
          come from energy consumption, transportation, food choices, and waste
          generation.
        </p>

      <section className="learn-section">
        <h2>Major Sources of Carbon Emissions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Electricity and energy usage</li>
          <li>Transportation (cars, flights, public transport)</li>
          <li>Food consumption and dietary choices</li>
          <li>Waste and recycling habits</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="learn-section">
        <h2>Why Reducing Carbon Footprint Matters</h2>
        <p>
          High carbon emissions contribute to climate change, global warming,
          and environmental degradation. Reducing emissions helps protect
          ecosystems, improves air quality, and ensures long-term environmental
          stability.
